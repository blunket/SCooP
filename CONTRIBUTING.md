# Contributing to SCooP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SCooP! We want it to be as easy
as possible to contribute to this project. Let's make it great.

Whether you're reporting bugs, discussing code quality, submitting a fix,
adding a feature, or you're interested in becoming a maintainer, please read
below!

## We use GitHub

We use GitHub for hosting, tracking issues, feature requests, and pull requests.
This may change in the future (this project may move to Gitlab eventually,
should we need Gitlab's features).

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please be mindful of this when contributing.

## GNU AGPL v3

This repository is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License. The
most important part of this license is below:

>The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

## Bug Reports

If you're reporting a bug, open a new issue on GitHub. Include what platform
you are running. Add as much detail as possible, including images if necessary.
Explain what you were doing when you encountered the bug, steps to reproduce,
what you expected would happen, what actually happened, and any other details
you think may be useful in solving the bug report.

## Linting

We follow the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com) guidelines.
Please ensure your code conforms to these guidelines, or else the linter will
complain. You can lint your code by running `yarn run lint`.
